- Determine pass/fail status
- Display final grade and status to user

## 2. ATM Banking System

**Program Description:**
Develop a program that simulates an ATM with options to check balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and exit. The program should maintain a running balance and prevent withdrawals that would result in a negative balance.

**Key Features:**
- Authenticate user with PIN
- Display menu of available operations
- Handle balance inquiries
- Process deposits and update balance

**Key Features:**
- Add new products to inventory with unique IDs
- Update existing product information
- Remove products from inventory
- Search for products by ID or name
- Display current inventory status
- Track low stock items
- Generate inventory reports

## 4. Prime Number Checker

**Program Description:**
Create a program that determines whether a given number is prime or not. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself with no other factors.

**Key Features:**
- Accept numerical input from user
- Verify if input is valid (positive integer)
- Use efficient algorithm to check for primality
- Display result with explanation
- Option to check additional numbers

## 5. Temperature Conversion Tool

**Program Description:**
Develop a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The user should be able to select the input and output temperature scales.

**Key Features:**
- Accept temperature value input
- Allow selection of source unit (C, F, or K)
- Allow selection of target unit (C, F, or K)
- Perform accurate conversion using correct formulas
- Display converted result with appropriate unit
- Option for multiple conversions

## 6. Library Book Management System

**Program Description:**
Design a program that manages a library's book collection, allowing librarians to add books, remove books, check out books to members, and return books. Track availability status for each book.

- Maintain database of books (title, author, ISBN, status)
- Maintain database of library members
- Process for adding new books to collection
- Process for removing obsolete books
- Book checkout procedure with due dates
- Book return procedure with potential late fees
- Search functionality by title, author, or ISBN
- Report generation for overdue books

## 7. Fibonacci Sequence Generator

**Program Description:**
Create a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

**Key Features:**
- Accept number of terms to generate
- Validate input is reasonable (positive integer within limits)
- Generate sequence using efficient algorithm
- Display sequence with appropriate formatting
- Option to save sequence to file

## 8. Calendar Event Scheduler

**Program Description:**
Develop a program that allows users to schedule events on a calendar. Users should be able to add events with dates, times, and descriptions, view all events, and delete events.

**Key Features:**
- Add events with title, date, time, and description
- Validate date and time inputs
- Store events in organized data structure
- Display events for a specific day, week, or month
